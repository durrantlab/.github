# Durrant Lab @ University of Pittsburgh

We develop open-source tools for computer-aided drug discovery (CADD), focusing on molecular docking, dynamics, cheminformatics, and machine learning. Our research helps identify small-molecule ligands, study protein function, and accelerate therapeutic discovery.

Our tools are free to use and built for reproducibility, education, and extensibility. We welcome contributions and scientific collaborations.
